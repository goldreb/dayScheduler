# dayScheduler

## Getting Started
 This is a homework for University of Oregon Bootcamp. It utilizes the use of Moment.js - a third party API.

## Objective
In this homework we are tasks to build a work day scheduler based on a 9 - 5 work hour day.
As the day progress the rows will change color from green === future, red === present, and gray === past.
The user can input tasks into the textarea and click the checkmark to store it into the local storage.
